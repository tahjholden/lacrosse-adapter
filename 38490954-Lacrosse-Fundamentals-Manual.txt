                                             Welcome
Welcome to the BSA Lacrosse Program—and congratulations! You are part of a pioneering effort to
build up the ancient North American game of lacrosse in Europe, where this great game is growing by
leaps and bounds. The BSA program is playing an important role in this development, and we are
currently one of a growing number of youth lacrosse programs in Continental Europe. Of course, the
game is being played by schools and club teams in England, while club teams in the Netherlands,
Germany and the Czech Republic, among others, are now sponsoring Under-18 and Under-14 teams.

The BSA program is designed both to introduce young players to the fundamentals of lacrosse, to hone
the talents of those players who have been playing either in their home countries or who have come up
through the ranks of other local programs and to help this great game develop in Europe.

Lacrosse is infectiously fun to play and to watch, and its not surprising that it is now considered the
fastest growing game in the United States. The number of US high schools fielding boys lacrosse teams
doubled between 2000 and 2007 from 1,273 to 2,612 and the women’s game is growing at comparable
rates. Once a game that was largely played on the North East of the United States and throughout
Canada, where it was long the official national sport, today it is spreading like wildfire in California,
Colorado, Texas, Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, among other states, and
the number of players is increasing in Canada, England and Australia as well. The sport is also
growing at the US collegiate level and virtually every major college and university is now either
sporting an NCAA Division 1, 2 or 3 lacrosse team or hosting highly organized club teams that have
become varsity teams in all but name. (These club teams compete in leagues outside of the NCAA
mandate.) The NCAA Finals now draw some 50,000 fans in what has become an annual get together of
the lacrosse “tribe”. Indoor and outdoor professional lacrosse has also taken of in North America and
as it does, it attracts more young boys and girls into the game. Although starting from a much lower
level, the game is also bursting onto the scene in Europe with the number of players and club teams
increasing every year. European television networks have recently begun to broadcast North American
lacrosse games, and this will greatly assist all of those working to popularize the game on this side of
the Atlantic. Here is radio interview with long-time Princeton Coach Bill Tierney on the growth of the
game. http://laxbuzz.com/2009/06/16/growth-of-lacrosse-video-new-university-of-denver-mens-

                                                                                                                           3




The NCAA Final Four Weekend –Finals and Semi-Finals now draw some 125 thousand fans. It has become the annual get
together of the global lacrosse “tribe”. It was most recently held in Boston in May 2009 but moves to Baltimore in 2010.

Lacrosse is justifiably called the fastest game played on two feet. Those who see it for the first time
cannot help but be impressed by the speed of play and skill of the players and they immediately notice
the parallels with ice hockey. But lacrosse also has elements that are common with basketball, soccer
and American football. Indeed basketball was invented by a lacrosse player who incorporated the logic
of lacrosse into the fundamental movements of basketball—pick and roll, sliding, zone defense, cutting
to the man with the ball etc.. Lacrosse is also a physical game but some of the greatest players are small
in stature. Quickness, speed, creativity and intelligence are lacrosse virtues although size and strength
have their place as well. In that sense, this is a democratic game and can be played by many kinds of
athletes.

But lacrosse is also a game requiring great skill and it takes time, patience and effort to develop those
skills. All lacrosse players must be able to wield their sticks left handed and right handed, shoot and
pass with accuracy, catch from many angles, run while cradling the ball and scoop the ball off the
ground. These are all tricks that are not easy to master. Good players work on this in practice, during
school breaks, and at home. In fact, all great players and their sticks are inseparable. It is important to
recognize that two days of practice a week is not sufficient to develop the ambidextrous stick skills and
the deft footwork needed to play this game properly, and players should keep a stick at school and play
catch and shoot whenever they can grab a few free moments. Its fun to do, its social, and the rewards
will be quickly apparent on the field!

This manual should be seen as a tool for current and future players and coaches and it might also be of
interest to parents and fans. In these pages, we introduce the basics of lacrosse, the equipment, the field,
the rules and guidelines for the four positions: Goalie, Defense, Midfield and Attack. Probably the best
feature in these pages is the links to instructional videos that have been posted on the internet. These
videos are invaluable. Some of them feature the best players in the world showing how they do what
they do on the lacrosse field and in practice. We strongly urge the players, both rookies and veterans, to
click through these links. They will learn a great deal, and this will reinforce what the coaches are
trying to teach. There are also links to dynamic play diagrams discussed by leading coaches. These
outline a number of plays that may be taught over the course of the season. These too are worth
watching because they demonstrate the basic team plays of lacrosse and the fundamental motion of
offensive and defensive units. There is an internal logic to movements on the lacrosse field, even
though there is a great deal of room for creative improvisation. These videos help players to
understand this logic and will thus provide a framework for creative play.

Those native Americans such as the Iroquois and the Huron, for whom lacrosse has long been a central
element of their culture, introduced a simple principal that informed their play: Honor the Game. It is
sage advice, which implies not only great respect for this graceful game, but also for one’s teammates,
coaches, opponents and fans. This simple principal will also inform the way Lacrosse is played in
Brussels.




                                        Lacrosse Fundamentals




               Native American matches were considered sacred events and could last as long as 3 days.




Crosse -- also known as stick.
The Crosse must be between 40 - 42" for attackmen / mid-fielders and
52 - 72" for defensemen. The head is to be 6 1/2 - 10" wide. Goalies
head may be 10 - 12" wide. All Bantam and Lightning players will
use shorter sticks. Crosse contains three components:

Shaft or handle -- made from a variety of materials; including wood,
metal or plastic. Most common is aluminum and its alloys. Aluminum
and metal alloy shafts are the most popular for their relative strength
and light weight.
                                                                                                              5
The length of the shaft should grow with a player's size, development and skills. When selecting a
shaft, the most important point to consider is how it feels in a player's hands. Younger, more
inexperienced players, need to concentrate on feel and weight, not on materials of construction.
Strength of shaft becomes critical with older, stronger, more experienced players.

Head -- its sole purpose is to act as a frame for the pocket. The head can be made of wood, plastic, or
other synthetic material. The most common is plastic, because of its strength and lightness. There are a
wide variety of heads available. It is best for beginners and younger players to stay with basic, simple
heads.

Pocket - net that forms a pocket in which the ball is carried and cradled and from which the ball is
thrown. The pocket is the single most important and controllable part of the Crosse. It is very important
that players get to know their pockets and how to adjust them. A player with average equipment, but
good stick skills, and a good feel for the pocket will always perform better than a player with expensive
equipment and average skills. Pockets come in two types: Traditional and Mesh.

Traditional - consists of four leather thongs, around which are interwoven synthetic cord and shooting
strings. This produces a more accurate pass and shot, making it easier to control and absorb the ball.
Major drawback: it takes time to soften the leather and form the proper pocket.

Mesh - a single piece of open nylon mesh material that is stretched between the sides of the head and
attached with nylon cord, through which shooting strings run. This forms a good pocket immediately, is
durable, and easy to adjust. This pocket is more forgiving while learning the basics and is preferred for
those just starting the game.

Shooting Strings are made of heavy-duty shoelace material, which are interwoven across the pocket.
The purpose is to form a release point of the pocket. The actual pocket is formed just below the last
shooting string. The objective is to form a short, smooth path for the ball to travel out of the stick.

The pocket must be adjusted so that the top of the ball does not fall below the bottom edge of the head
when the stick is held horizontally. The purpose of this rule is so a player can't make it difficult for an
opponent to dislodge the ball with a check.

For safety purposes, all sticks are to have a plastic or wood plug covering the end of the stick opposite
the head. Sticks are not to be physically bent, or altered, other than material added on the exterior
surface for improved grip and weight.

Top hand -- that hand that is closest to the head (for a right hander, it is your right hand)

Bottom hand -- that hand that is closest to the bottom of the handle.

Catch and Throw -- how we move the ball from one person to another and back again and up and
down the field. It is a push with the top hand and a pull down with the bottom like a lever, while
stepping toward your target.

Box area - that area where the head of your stick is when properly held. The area we try to throw the
ball toward.
                                                                                                               6
Scoop -- how we get the ball off the field. We never use our hands. The stick should be parallel to the
ground, we bend our knees and accelerate through the ball, pushing the head of the stick under and
through the ball.

Rake -- we try never do this, we scoop.

Cradle -- what we do to keep the ball in the head of the stick. The top hand controls the motion of the
stick in your hands and you gently roll the handle in you hand while moving your arm up and down.
The bottom hand is simply used as a guide. When we catch the ball, there is a slight cradle to keep the
ball from flying out.

Goal -- that 6' x 6' object with the net in the crease that we are attempting to get the ball in or keep the
ball from going in. Also what is achieved when the ball goes into it.

Crease -- an actual lined circle with a 9 ft. radius where the goal is located and where the goalie resides
during play on their defensive end of the field. Also, no Offensive player is ever allowed in the crease
at any time. Defenders are allowed in the crease but can not carry the ball into the crease. Goalies can
handle the ball in the crease but after possession only have 4 seconds to get the ball out of the crease.

The Ball -- is white, yellow, or orange and is made of solid rubber. The ball is 7 3/4 - 8" in
circumference and weighs 5 - 5 1/4 ounces. The ball is NEVER to be thrown in the house! Ball is
what is "called or yelled" when the ball is on the ground and a player is going to pick it up.

Release -- what a player says after he picks the ball up to signify to his teamates that he has the ball.

Helmet -- Each player is required to wear a protective helmet that includes a metal face mask with a
chin pad, and a cupped four point chin strap fastened at all points to the helmet. All helmets and face
masks should be NOCSAE (National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment)
approved.

The fit is the most important point to consider when selecting a helmet.

MOUTHPIECE REQUIRED - Must be a highly visible color and worn at all times while on the field.

GLOVES; SHOULDER, and ARM PADS; Cleats, AND JERSEYS are required protective
equipment for all regulation games. Rib Pads and athletic protectors are highly recommended.

The games originally were seen as a way to train warriors, but were also played to resolve disputes between
villages. The military writer Clausewitz might have called it war by other means.

                               Old School: Lacrosse players once used heavy ash sticks.



Men's Lacrosse Rules

Men's lacrosse is a contact game played by ten players: a goalie, three defensemen, three midfielders
and three attackmen. The object of the game is to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. The team
scoring the most goals wins.

Each team must keep at least four players, including the goalie, in its defensive half of the field and
three in its offensive half. Three players (midfielders) may roam the entire field.

Collegiate games are 60 minutes long, with 15-minute quarters. Generally, high school games are 48
minutes long, with 12-minute quarters. Likewise, youth games are 32 minutes long, with eight-minute
quarters. Each team is given a two-minute break between the first and second quarters, and the third
and fourth quarters. Halftime is ten minutes long.

Teams change sides between periods. Each team is permitted two timeouts each half. The team
winning the coin toss chooses the end of the field it wants to defend first.

The players take their positions on the field: four in the defensive clearing area, one at the center, two
in the wing areas and three in their attack goal area.

Men's lacrosse begins with a face-off. The ball is placed between the sticks of two squatting players at
the center of the field. The official blows the whistle to begin play. Each face-off player tries to control
the ball. The players in the wing areas can run after the ball when the whistle sounds. The other players
must wait until one player has gained possession of the ball, or the ball has crossed a goal area line,
before they can release.
                                                                                                          9

Center face-offs are also used at the start of each quarter and after a goal is scored. Field players must
use their crosses to pass, catch and run with the ball. Only the goalkeeper may touch the ball with his
hands. A player may gain possession of the ball by dislodging it from an opponent's crosse with a stick
check. A stick check is the controlled poking and slapping of the stick and gloved hands of the player
in possession of the ball.

Body checking is permitted if the opponent has the ball or is within five yards of a loose ball. All body
contact must occur from the front or side, above the waist and below the shoulders, and with both
hands on the stick. An opponent's crosse may also be stick checked if it is within five yards of a loose
ball or ball in the air. Aggressive body checking is discouraged.

If the ball or a player in possession of the ball goes out of bounds, the other team is awarded
possession. If the ball goes out of bounds after an unsuccessful shot, the player nearest to the ball when
and where it goes out of bounds is awarded possession.

An attacking player cannot enter the crease around the goal, but may reach in with his stick to scoop a
loose ball.

A referee, umpire and field judge supervise field play. A chief bench official, timekeepers and scorers
assist.

Men's Lacrosse Personal & Technical Fouls
There are personal fouls and technical fouls in boy's lacrosse. The penalty for a personal foul results in
a one to three minute suspension from play and possession to the team that was fouled. Players with
five personal fouls are ejected from the game. The penalty for a technical foul is a thirty-second
suspension if a team is in possession of the ball when the foul is committed, or possession of the ball to
the team that was fouled if there was no possession when the foul was committed.

Note: The US Lacrosse Youth Council has developed modified rules for ages 15 and under play.

Personal Fouls
Slashing: Occurs when a player's stick viciously contacts an opponent in any area other than the stick
or gloved hand on the stick.
Tripping: Occurs when a player obstructs his opponent at or below the waist with the crosse, hands,
arms, feet or legs.
Cross Checking: Occurs when a player uses the handle of his crosse between his hands to make
contact with an opponent.
                                                                                                                    10
Unsportsmanlike Conduct: Occurs when any player or coach commits an act which is considered
unsportsmanlike by an official, including taunting, arguing, or obscene language or gestures.




The cross check will get you time in the penalty box in field lacrosse, although it is permitted in box lacrosse.

Unnecessary Roughness: Occurs when a player strikes an opponent with his stick or body using
excessive or violent force.
Illegal Crosse: Occurs when a player uses a crosse that does not conform to required specifications. A
crosse may be found illegal if the pocket is too deep or if any other part of the crosse was altered to
gain an advantage.
Illegal Body Checking: Occurs when any of the following actions takes place:
a. body checking an opponent who is not in possession of the ball or within five yards of a loose ball.
b. avoidable body check of an opponent after he has passed or shot the ball.
c. body checking an opponent from the rear or at or below the waist.
d. body checking an opponent above the shoulders. A body check must be below the shoulders and
above the waist, and both hands of the player applying the body check must remain in contact with his
crosse.
Illegal Gloves: Occurs when a player uses gloves that do not conform to required specifications. A
glove will be found illegal if the fingers and palms are cut out of the gloves, or if the glove has been
altered in a way that compromises its protective features.
Technical Fouls
Holding: Occurs when a player impedes the movement of an opponent or an opponent's crosse.
Interference: Occurs when a player interferes in any manner with the free movement of an opponent,
except when that opponent has possession of the ball, the ball is in flight and within five yards of the
player, or both players are within five yards of a loose ball.
Offsides: Occurs when a team does not have at least four players on its defensive side of the midfield
line or at least three players on its offensive side of the midfield line.
Pushing: Occurs when a player thrusts or shoves a player from behind.
Screening: Occurs when an offensive player moves into and makes contact with a defensive player
with the purpose of blocking him from the man he is defending.
Stalling: Occurs when a team intentionally holds the ball, without conducting normal offensive play,
with the intent of running time off the clock.
Warding Off: Occurs when a player in possession of the ball uses his free hand or arm to hold, push or
control the direction of an opponent's stick check.

                        (See More Videos in the back section of this manual.)

Essential to every team is a good goalie. A goalie needs to be a leader with very good knowledge of the
game, its rules and understanding the needs of the team. The following covers the fundamental of
playing goalie.
            o Simple Concept: intercept the ball in its path with your stick or body before it goes in
                the goal.
            o Musts: Cup, Helmet, Goalie Stick, Chest protector, throat guard, and gloves. Anything
                else is up to you.
            o Goalie Positioning
                     Fingers should hold the stick, but not choke it. Handle should be in fingers not
                         palms.
                     Hands should be about 12" apart in a comfortable relaxed position.
                     Arms should be away from your body, but you should not have flying wings, far
                         enough so you can easily maneuver the stick in a clock and counter clock- wise
                         fashion (like a baseball player). Far enough away from your head so you don′t
                         hit your mask when you move it from stick side high to off stick side high.
                     Feet should be shoulder distance apart and weight should be forward. Not
                         necessarily on your toes but definitely not back on your heals.
                     Body position should be similar to a linebacker, a tennis player: an athlete.
                     Goalie Stick should be positioned just off your shoulder covering the "Box
                         Area". If you are right handed, you hold the top of the stick (toward the stick
                         head) with your right hand and the bottom hand (left hand for righties) should be
                         about 12" away. Arms bend at elbows and away from your body. Head of stick
                         should be slightly forward and you should be ready to step toward the ball in an
                         easy fluid motion.
            o Step to the ball “ Legs come together
                     Attack the ball. Get your whole body in the path of the ball. Your stick gets
                         there first while starting to step to the path of the ball.
                     You should step to the ball beginning with the foot and leg from the side the ball
                         came from. If the ball (bounce, high, or low) came toward you from the right of
                         your body, you should step with your right foot and leg followed by your left
                         foot and leg coming together with your right foot and leg. If the ball came from
                         toward you from the left side of your body, you should step to the path with your
                         left foot and leg followed by your right foot and leg coming together with your
                         left foot and leg.
                     If the ball is a bounce shot position your chin at the point of the bounce whiling
                         stepping to get in the path of the ball. Your stick gets to the ball first with your
                         whole body following.
                     This is true for any shot. Every time. Practice, Practice, Practice! Attack,
                         attack, attac
            o Goalie Position in the Goal
                     When the ball is in front of the opening of the Goal, you should be in the goalie
                         position on the imaginary "half moon" between the pipes and move as the ball
                                                                                                      13
                    moves. As the ball moves from pipes, side, front (top) right and left, you should
                    be moving on the half moon to be in position to attack any shot that comes near
                    the goal.
                 When the ball is behind at X (directly behind the goal) or off pipes right and left,
                    you should be positioned at the center of the moon, waiting in goalie position
                    except with your bottom hand at the end of the handle so that you are in position
                    to "steal the ball". Only make the attempt if you can be successful. Do not be
                    over anxious so as to be out of position for the next opportunity to make a save.
                 When the ball is thrown from back to front, you move with the side the ball went
                    to first. If I am standing at the x of the moon, and the ball is thrown from back
                    right to side left, I turn (clockwise) with my right side moving first to get my
                    stick to the ball side as fast as I can the rest of my body follows my head. If the
                    ball is thrown from back right to side right I move (counter clockwise) my right
                    side to the ball first followed by stepping with my right foot to the right side of
                    the goal.
         o   Save (catch/cradle) the ball
                 Don′t pop at it. Cradle it into your stick like other players do. Don′t stab or pop
                    it. Catch it.
                 Make sure your pocket is broken in.
                 Make sure your stick is in good repair. Fixing any loose or broken strings prior
                    to game.

and body in front as well.

         o   Throw the ball
                 You must be able to cradle and throw just like any of your teammates. They
                   must be able to rely on you to control the ball, catch the ball, cradle the ball, and
                   throw the ball with consistency and accuracy. Half field accurate and consistent
                                                                                           14
             throws at a minimum.
            To throw the ball you position your hands in a throwing position. Bottom hand
             at the end of the handle and top hand about 12 to 18 inches away as to allow the
             "levered" throwing of the ball. Always step toward your target and lead the
             runner just like a quarter back would lead a wide receiver. Don′t throw buddy
             passes.
            After you pass the ball, look to get back in the cage.
o   Crease
         The crease is yours; it is your domain; it is your protection. Your sole
          responsibility is to keep the ball from going into the goal. You can use the
          crease to help you do that.
        Remember to always clamp on the ball with your stick when it is near the
          crease. Rake it back to you but be careful not to allow it to pop out. Get your
          defensemen to know what "clear the crease" means.
        After you have possession of the ball, you have three seconds to get the ball out
          of your crease (pass it or walk/run it out).
        Look for the idiot attack man standing in front of your crease while you are
          attempting to make a clear.
        If there is no fast break or out let pass, take the ball behind.
        You cannot go back into the crease after you have left it with the ball. You can
          enter the crease at anytime without the ball. Remember the ball in the back of
          the net trick.
o   Communicate
        Talk to your coach about the proper calls he wants you to make. You need to
          use an authoritative voice without yelling. Know everyone′s name, nick
          name. Talk to provide information not to talk.
        Some of the calls covered:
              • Stick side high, med. Low, off stick high, med. low
              • Check sticks

                      Goalie Tips from the Best: Billy Daye
         Former North Carolina All-ACC Goaltender and USCLA Player of the Year

                        (from a recent interview by Great Atlantic Lacrosse)

Fundamentals
Your feet should be shoulder width apart and your hands should be way from your body to
prevent being handcuffed on offside shots. Your hands should be 12-18" apart. Most importantly,
you need to find a comfort zone where you are ready to attack the ball and make the save.
Practice your outlets just as much as you practice making saves. There is nothing worse than
making a great save and then giving the ball back to the other team because of a bad pass.

Communication/Leadership
Talk to your defense and let them know where the ball is on the field. As the quarterback of the
defense, you must recognize situations such as fast breaks and direct your defensemen to the
correct positions. The tone of your voice says a lot; if you are not a vocal person, you better start
being one. Stay positive even after a goal is scored. A goalie who has control of his defense will
have the respect of the team.

Attitude
If you give up a goal do not get down on yourself or your defense. You can't take the goal off the
scoreboard but you can recognize what you did wrong, practice that step or specific movement,
AND GET THE NEXT ONE. Have confidence in your abilities to stop the ball. If you lose your
confidence, your defense will soon follow. Always believe you can save every shot.

Drills
Your warm-up should be a warm-up, not target practice for the best shooters on your team. Find
someone you trust to give you a proper warm-up. Tell the shooter what you want. I recommend:


                             *   8-10 shots stickside high
                             *   8-10 shots off-stick high
                             *   8-10 shots stickside hip
                             *   8-10 shots offstick hip
                             *   8-10 stickside bounce
                             *   8-10 off-stickside bounce
                             *   10-15 shots "mix it up"

In Conclusion
Watch and listen to the great goaltenders and notice their different styles. Take what works best
for them and adapt it to your specific style of play. Good luck this season!

                                      Attack Play
Attackman need to be able to score goals, make assists (feeds or passes), get ground balls
and “ride” the defense. Every attackman needs to be able to catch and throw
accurately. Sticks skills are paramount. Better attackman will be able to use the stick with
both hands. Quickness and guile are highly recommended.

Tips for Attack Play:
1. Make your defenseman play you and you alone every second you are in the game. Keep
    moving all the time so that he must center his attention on you and not be in position to
    help out his fellow defense men. Make your defensemen guess by changing speed,
    direction and cradle. Learn to pass while stepping away from the check.
2. In moving the ball around the circle, make all passes sharp, short, and to the outside,
    away from the defense man.
3. Make feed passes hard.
4. When you have the ball, never stand still - keep moving all the time - if necessary run back
    and forth - but keep moving. When you are ready to make a pass, take one step back
    quickly and move.
5. All feed passes must be thrown directly overhand or directly underhand - not sidearm.
6. Always move to meet every pass, and circle away from your defense man.
7. When you have the ball, be constantly faking passes - keep your defense man's stick
    moving.
8. When in possession of ball, make the defense man play your stick - watch his stick - the
    position of it will determine the direction of your feed and the type of dodge you might try.
9. Take pains to make every pass good.
10. Never make a pass to a man who is covered just to get rid of the ball.
11. If an attackman is being guarded hard by his defender and can't dodge or get away - the
    nearest man on each side goes to help him.
12. On all long shots, a man must be on the crease and one behind the goal.
13. On every screen shot the creaseman should check-up on the defense man's stick, and
    immediately face the goalie, so that he is ready to score a garbage goal (bat in a
    rebounded ball).
14. After receiving a pass, as the ball moves around the outside, look first at the man who
    threw you the ball to see what he is doing, then at the crease.
15. If you receive a pass after cutting and haven't got a good shot, hold onto the ball.
16. We recommend you shoot bounce shots. At the same time we suggest you shoot for open
    space – where the goalie isn’t playing. When possible, place all shots, usually for a far
    corner, and shoot the ball hard.
17. After picking up a loose ball, turn and face the crease immediately. If nobody is open,
    move in fast until you are picked up.
18. Don't dodge if there is an open man. Don't hold the ball long unless you are planning a
    dodge. Keep it moving with quick, short passes.
19. Always be in position to back up shots and feeds. When a cut is made, or a shot is taken,
                                                                                                17
    the whole attack must play a part, moving to be in a position to backup a pass or a shot.
    Control the ball and you will control the game!
20. Never try to dodge when men are in position to back up.
21. Never try to force in, with the ball or by a pass, if the defense is drawn in. Pull them out
    first.
22. Never stand so close together that one man can cover two attackmen.
23. When there is a loose ball on the ground, go after it fast and hard, you must control the
    ball!
24. Always keep your field balanced in order that you stay in better position to back up, and
    give your teammates space to work in.
25. Shoot the ball, but only when you feel you have a good shot.
26. Always have one, preferably two, men behind the goal to back up shots.
27. Time your cuts, don't cut if the man with the ball is not watching or not in position to pass.
28. Make full cuts - go through and out - don't cut at half speed or hang around the crease
    after your cut.
29. Zig your cuts, fake left - go right, fake right - go left. Don't always run at the same speed,
    change of pace is a very effective method of getting open.
30. After the ball has been cleared, if you have a wide open opportunity to dodge, do it, or if
    you are sure a man is open, pass to him, otherwise settle the ball down and let your
    offense get set up. Remember, after a clear the midfielders will need time to catch their
    breath. Middies rest on offense, not defense, Control The Ball!
31. Every man on the attack should earn at least three different types of dodges – roll dodge
    (inside and outside), face dodge and bull dodge. Try to figure out which dodge will be
    most effective on your defenseman.
32. When you lose the ball, ride (play defense against the defense) it. The close attack must
    ride and ride hard until the ball is past midfield.
33. Don't rush at a man when riding - particularly behind the goal. Force him to pass - force
    him in the direction where there is help. Talk all the time and run hard. The success of an
    attack depends on their riding ability and their desire to get the ball back.
34. Always remember that teamwork is the key to a good attack play!

                            Middie Play
Defensive Middie Vid http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGn6zYr6mSQ

To be a top midfielder you must possess the whole package – run, shot, pass, dodge, face off and
play defense. Don't focus too much on any individual aspect of the game.

Here are some things to work on:

Shooting - During practice, focus about 90% of the time shooting on the run. That is really all
you will use in a game. There are a few keys to scoring from outside. First, take alot of bounce
shots. They go in more frequently. Second, try to be deceptive. Try to hide your stick behind your
body until the last second. Finally, and most difficult, shoot with the proper technique. Hands and
elbows high and away from your body, hands 12 inches apart close to the bottom of your handle,
turn your shoulders and hips and follow through. Look for your rebound and get ready to get
back on Defense if the goalie makes the save.

Dodging: Want to be a great dodger? Here's a few tips... Don't dodge with the intention of
blowing by your defender. Your thought should be to make a move to get your hands free for a
pass or shot, if only for a second or two. Execute all of your moves in a game at FULL SPEED.
(Practice your moves this way too) Learn to play lefty and righty equally as well. It does not
                                                                                                     19
matter how good you are at a dodge. If you make the move the same way every time, your
defenseman will recognize this and you'll never get your hands free.




A Syracuse midfielder getting one quick step on Georgetown’s long pole defender. Now he’s ready to
go to the goal.



Run directly at the defender at 3/4 speed and when you get about 10 feet from him change speed
to a full out sprint and explode past him to the goal.

The best places on the field to dodge from are the wings - left and right and the middle top of the
box. It is hardest to cut off angles from these spots.

Face-off - Don't rely on the other guy all the time. Learn some moves and practice!

Middie Defense - Learn what it takes to be an individual "D" guy both on and off ball. Also learn
the concepts of good team defense.

Do not overplay your man. Position yourself to direct him away the dangerous shooting areas.
Defending players should be in an athletic position with knees bent, legs a shoulder width apart,
and feet in a heel to toe alignment. As in basketball, the defender rests on the balls of his feet and
is ready to move in any direction quickly.

When playing from the center midfield position, encourage the attacking midfielder to move to his
weak side. On the wings encourage the attacking midfielder to move toward the sideline and not
towards the more dangerous center of the field.

Talk to your defensive team mates. Middies off-ball should be prepared to back up their
teammates who are on ball. Slide from inside out. Off ball players should be sloughed off toward
                                                                                                    20
the crease while on-ball players are closer to their man. The closer the player with the ball moves
towards the goal, the tighter the defender should play him.

Conditioning/Stamina - As a middie you need to be the most well conditioned player on the
field. How else are you going to make a big stop on D and then go to the O side and stick a
corner?

Ground Balls – Ground balls win games! Be relentless, and learn the proper technique. Ground
balls win games and will keep you on the field if you're good at it.

Between the Restraining lines- Just be smart, move the ball to a player in front of you and
don't sell out. That means don't go for a check and get beat in this part of the field, you’re better
off getting in the hole preventing unsettled play.

Off ball play is an overlooked and a very important part of the attack and midfielder's game. 60-
70% of the goals scored are assisted by a teammate. To get these scoring opportunities however,
you must know how to move without the ball.

Here are some tips for better Middie play:

   1. After throwing a pass, immediately cut to the goal for a return pass (give and go), Most
      defenseman relax after you give up the ball...make them pay.
   2. If the defenseman covering you goes to double or help a teammate, follow behind him and
      get in a passing lane and communicate to your teammate that he’s being doubled.
   3. Always cut to the ball as hard and fast as you do when you dodge. You'll be surprised how
      open you get just by cutting 100%.
   4. Watch top level lacrosse and see how the middies and attackmen cut, move without the
      ball and stick handle.
Basketball has similar offensive and defensive strategies as lacrosse. Watch it and learn.

Key Video http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-play-one-on-one-defense-
17863/view/


   Defensemen need to have very good footwork, be able to catch and throw accurately up to 30
   yards on the run, understand the concept of teamwork and ′backing up′, make quick decision
   on who and when to play an attackman, be confident in the individual, 1-on-1 skills and need
   to communicate to their entire defense.
   Defensive Play Tips:
   1. Know who is covering the ′hole′ at all times.
   2. Play defense with your hands out in front of you, not to your side.
   3. Play your man â€“ man on man and stick on stick.
   4. Play defense between your man and the goal.
   5. Don't rush an attackman after he has caught the ball. If he is receiving a rather long pass
       and you are sure you can reach him before the ball, go after him, checking his stick and
       hitting him with your body.
   6. As a pass is made to the man you are playing, move out to cover him as the ball is moving
       to him, so that you are in position as he catches it. Don't wait until he has caught the ball,
       and then move out on him.
   7. Never take a step into a man while playing him on defense.
   8. Once the attackman has the ball, keep him guarding his stick and worry him by poke
       checking, slap checking, etc., don't give him much chance to look over his field, make him
       worry about you. Don't force or rush him - there is a big difference between the
       two. Make the attack make the first move.
   9. When not poking at the man with ball, keep your stick a little above the height of your
       attack man's shoulder. Don't ever carry it at your side, KEEP IT UP!
   10. When your man hasn't got the ball, always play slightly to the ball side of him, so that you
       gain a step as he cuts toward the ball. If he cuts away from the ball, the pass must go over
       your head which leaves you in good position to intercept or check.
   11. When your man hasn't got the ball, stand sideways to the man and ball. Keep your head
       on a ′swivel′. You must use split vision watching both man and ball.
   12. There must be plenty of talk on defense. The following are the most important examples of
       when to talk: a) The defensive player on each side of the ball must let the player on the
       ball know if he is-backed up. b) If a man leaves to back up he must let the defense know
       he is leaving, so that they may shift. c) The man playing the ball must holler, "I've got-the
       ball". d) If a man cuts, the defense man playing him should yell "cutter" so that he alerts
       the rest of the defense for a possible switch. e) If a switch is necessary, both men call
       "SWITCH".
   13. If a man leaves to back up on a dodge, the whole defense slides a man, leaving the man
       farthest from the ball open.
   14. Only in extreme cases, should the defenseman on the crease leave to back up. Example:
       To stop a play that would end up in a score.
   15. Never cross your feet while playing an attackman unless you are forced to run to keep up
       with him.
   16. Never throw a ball just to get rid of it. Try never to ′cheap′ the ball up field unless directed
       by the coach.
   17. Always scoop a loose ball. Never rake at it. If there is a crowd, go through and either kick
       it or scoop it up.
   18. When you check, make you check short and hard, making your check across the man's
       forearm and following through with your body. Never raise your stick high to check.
   19. If a man dodges you, keep after him. You should catch him as your backer comes in from
       the front.
                                                                                              23
20. Never pass a ball across or in front of your goal.
21. If you are after a loose ball, but your attack man is ahead of you, press him hard if you
    cannot come up with the ball, but don't give him the opportunity to go around you.
22. After the man you are playing throws a ball, step back two steps quickly and be ready for a
    cut. Also always look in the direction of the ball as you drop off. Don't turn your back on
    the ball.
23. As the man you are playing starts a pass, check across his arms, but don't step in.
24. A. If the ball is out front, and your man is behind the goal, play on the pipe of the cage on
    the side of the goal your man is on. B. If the ball is behind the goal and your man is behind
    also although without the ball, go behind with him.
25. If you ever switch, STAY WITH THAT MAN until your team gets the ball or you have to
    switch again.
26. When clearing the ball, as you catch it, circle away from your stick side if you are moving
    in to receive the pass.
27. Never let an attack man clamp your stick. If you are on the crease on a screen shot, stop it
    or catch it, if you can't do either then move so that your goalie can see it.
28. Once the other team has cleared the ball, all defensemen must drop in fast, RUN HARD --
    THIS IS ONE TIME YOU CANNOT LOAF.
29. On clears, make all passes sharp, away from the (attackman) and, as a general rule, to the
    nearest open man.
30. On a clear, when making a pass to a man who is coming in to meet the ball throw it to his
    box area, so that he catches the ball in front of him, making it hard for a (attackman) to
    check him.
31. If the ball is rolling toward the midfield line, NEVER ALLOW your attackman to beat you to
    the ball. Be alert; use your stick to goose the ball to teammate. Don't let the attackman
    clamp your stick or lift it up so ball goes under and through. Remember, if the ball is 5

Pushing an attackman out as he shoots. “No shot unchallenged.”


                                      Footwork
Lacrosse is an anaerobic sport requiring intensive anaerobic training. You go on the field, you run as
hard as you can, and once you are winded, you come off the field for a substitute and you really should
have no more gas in the tank at that point. It is not a game for those inclined to save energy. In this
sense, it is far more like ice hockey than soccer. It means that the pace of the game is lightening fast,
and there are no excuses for players not running as hard as they can during their shift on the field. It is
not a game for lopping.

Footwork in lacrosse is a key element of the game. There are several footwork fundamentals that all
players need to keep in mind. First of all, lacrosse is played best by players that run. It is never played
standing still. The reason is that defenders eat static players for lunch!!! Defender, however, have tons
of problems with attacking players who are always on the move whether they have the ball or not. A
defender of a player who does not have a ball will find it very difficult to slide and double team if he
always has to keep his eye on his assignment. If his assignment is always standing still, he is far more
confident about making that slide. Don’t allow him the luxury!!! Always be moving or threatening to
cut. You create space by doing so, you bother your defenseman, and you might receive a perfect feed
by making the cut. Moving players make things happen on the field. Coaches can tell when a player has
a strong work ethic because they are typically those players who are moving without the ball, cutting or
                                                                                                       25
constantly feigning cuts to drive their defender crazy.

Players who want to receive a pass, should always cut directly to the passer or at angle more or less in
his direction. The exception are midfielders and defensemen who break away from their goalie after he
has made a save and is looking to make a quick outlet pass. In those cases, often the break is away from
the man with the ball and the catch is made over the shoulder. In any case, never stand still to receive a
pass. Once a defender sees a static player calling for the ball, that player will be immediately lined up
for a hard check and will probably end up on his rear end while the defender steals the bass and runs
down the field on a fast break in the other direction. Therefore attacking players who want the ball
should cut hard to the player holding the ball. The passer should also be moving forward and should
never throw with his feet flat. The cutter should have his stick by his head ready to receive the pass.
This principle holds true anywhere on the field.

Secondly, never run backwards or sideways when on offense. This leaves you vulnerable to a check,
and it leaves you off balance, easy to defend and in poor position to do anything with the ball when and
if you receive a pass. Players with the ball, accordingly, should never throw it to teammates who are
backpedaling or side-stepping. This often happens if two inexperienced offensive players are too close
to each other. The player without the ball backpedals to create space and then asks for the pass. Don't
ever do this!!!! If the player without the ball is too close to the ball carrier, then the former should
simply cut away, running as hard as he can and looking for a feed as he cuts. By cutting away, you
make it less likely that your defender will double team the player with the ball. Remember always cut
with your head up and look for a feed!! When you cut, go all away to the opposite side of the field
before rotating to your proper position. Do not stop at the goal and wait. That gums up the works. (The
only exception her is that a middie cutter, might stop briefly in front of the cage to set a pick for a
crease attackman but once the crease attackman has popped out for a feed then the middie should
continue his cut to the opposite side.)

The only players on the field who can legitimately run backwards are players on defense. Defensive
footwork is almost identical to defensive footwork in basketball. The feet are kept roughly at the width
of ones shoulders. The feet are always moving and defenders should never cross their feet. The closer
the attacking player is to the goal, the closer the defensive player is to him, but defenders feet are
always churning to ensure that he is well positioned to compensate quickly for any dodge the attacking
player attempts. If the defender does not move his feet, the attacking player will have no trouble
blowing by him on the way to the goal. Your quick footwork should always keep you between your
man and the goal.

Here are a few videos of great footwork drills and demonstrations. Some of these feature female
players and here the only difference is that in the womens game, the stick is held high on defense while
in the mens game, the stick is lower in order to check the hands of the attacking player.

                                            Dodging




                Virgina’s defenseman is big but the Duke attackman is quick.

There are three fundamental dodges used in lacrosse 1) Face Dodge (new version is the swim
dodge) 2) Roll Dodge 3) Redirection that become a whole host of dodges by other names
including Split Dodge, Inside/Outside Roll Dodge, Rocker Dodge and Zig Zag Dodge to
name a few.

We will demonstrate through description and e-lacrosse video illustration (see links below), each
of the fundamental dodges below:

1) Face Dodge:The face dodge is a great dodge to use when the defender is lunging at you. A
right handed face dodge starts with the stick in your right hand and bring the stick across the
front part of your body to the left side of your body. More advanced players will switch hands
after the stick is to the left side and now be running with the stick in their left hand. While running
at the defenseman, just before any contact, the stick is brought around the face to the side of the
body while the feet pivot the same way and a burst of speed loses the defender. Works best with
a lunging defender. www.e-lacrosse.com/2003/bayliz/l24hb.gif
2) Roll Dodge: a dodge around a defensive player where the ball carrier plants a foot in front of
the defender and rolls to the outside without changing speed or losing the ball until he is beyond
the defender and on his way. www.e-lacrosse.com/2003/bayliz/l12hb.gif
                                                                                                             27
Outside Roll: When sensing a defender's underplay on the Goal Line Extended, the attackman
steps past the GLE, plants his inside foot and rolls back outside the defender, shooting at a narrow
target, but hopefully one on one with the goalkeeper if executed properly like John Tavares in the
video clip. www.e-lacrosse.com/2002/wgfinal/c11hb.gif
Inside Roll: When sensing a defender's overplay on the GLE, the attackman plants his lead foot
and rolls back and around the defender with his outside leg, leaving him in a one-on-one with the
goalkeeper or an easy goal.www.e-lacrosse.com/2004/albumbc/a40.gif
3) Redirection or Split Dodge: a move similar to a crossover in basketball. While running one
direction, a player with the ball quickly steps in the opposite direction and changes hands leaving
the defender going the other way. www.e-lacrosse.com/2003/hopva/h18bhb.gif




                                       The Fast Break
The Fast Break explained in Video.
http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-run-fast-breaks-in-lacrosse-221455/view/



Many goals in lacrosse are scored through the fast break. This occurs when a midfielder manages to
break free of all the opponent’s midfield defenders and to run the ball into his offensive zone, which
automatically creates a 4 on 3 situations. Like a fast break in basketball, the key is moving the ball
quickly around the horn to find the one player, who invariably, will be open and who will then have a
free shot on the net. Its important to note that good defenders will be rotating as the ball moves around
the horn so the key is passing the ball faster than the defenders can move. It works in theory, but the
devil is in the execution, and its very important that players are able to throw and catch with both hands
or else they make the defenders job easy.

Position is also key. The normal fast break structure is that that a point attackman stands about twenty
yards to the front of the goal. The other two attackman are about ten yards to either side of the goal
and about two yards forward of the goal line.

The point man wants to be sure to be moving his feet toward the midfielder with ball and to be
sufficiently far away when the pass is made so as not to make the defenseman’s job easy. He should
catch the ball on the outside of the offensive box and not on the inside. This means that if he coming
from the right side of the field he will catch the ball right handed from the mid fielder. If he is on the
                                                                                                           28
left hand side of the field, he should catch it with his left hand. The middie should be sure to throw the
pass to the outside, not to the inside of the offensive box.

The point attackman thus needs to adjust his position depending on which side of the field the middie is
running down. He should never be on the same side of the field as this takes away the advantage of the
pass and makes the formation of a box impossible. The typical movement for a point man who wants
the ball is a half moon arc first toward the sideline and then toward the middie, who throws the pass
just before the box among the four attacking players is formed. (Diagram)

Once the point attackman has the ball he needs to survey the situation to figure out who the open man
is. This, in turn, depends on how the defense rotates. He can either throw a pass back to the middie who
brought the ball into the box (ie. a give and go) and the middie will then continue moving fast to the
goal either for a shot or a dump pass to a free attackman on either side of the goal (again depending on
the defensive rotation). Alternatively the point attackman can throw a pass to either attackman on the
two corners of the goal. They in turn can take a shot or a dump pass to one of the free players. It is
essential that the attackman to the right of the goalie hold his stick in his right hand side. The attackman
on the left hand side must hold his stick in his left hand side. Otherwise, the job of the defender is made
very easy as the stick will be easy to check.




                Shooting on the run is key on a fast break.

Remember: Fast breaks win game. Proper position, quick decisions, moving to the pass, and using the
right and left hands interchangeably are all essential parts of the fast break!!!

Here is a perfect explanation of how to run a fast break. All attack units on a field should designate
who is the point player on the fast break so that he is up high and ready to receive the first feed from
                                                                                                         29

                              Scooping a Ground Ball




                       The coach here should be screaming “Two hands on the stick!!!”

While lacrosse is meant to be played in the air, inevitably the ball will end up on the ground. Like a
rebound in basketball, a ground ball in lacrosse belongs to the team who picks it up first. A good
                                                                                                       30
scooping technique will keep the game moving and give your team the control it needs to be successful.
Call "ball" to alert your teammates you are going to scoop the ground ball. This will keep players from
bunching up around the ball and perhaps provide you with someone to throw to once you have control.
If members of the other team are in the area your teammates can body block them to give you an open
shot at the ball.Hold your stick with one hand close to the head and the other near the end of the handle.
The handle should be off to the side of your body for a free range of motion.Bend at the knees and
waist as you approach the ground ball. If your right hand is closest to the stick head, your right foot
should be closest to the ball. Reverse this for the left hand. Drop the head of your stick to ground level
a few inches behind the ball. The handle of your stick should also be kept low to create a flat approach.
Bring your body over the top of the ball. under the ball with the head of your stick. As you bring your
stick up through the ball pull it close to your body, cradle the ball and gradually straighten up to a
normal running position. Look to pass to an open teammate.

The first player to the ground ball scoops the call with his back hand low to the ground and call’s “BALL”.He
sprints straight ahead for at least six steps before turning away from his stick to protect it. His teammate calls
“MAN” and takes the defender out of the play with a body check.

Defensemen are allowed to run through their crease. Attackman have to run around it. Note how this
Maryland high school goalie is hugging the post and ready to intercept a pass from the attackman.
Note as well the perfect position of the attackman’s stick; it is perpendicular to the ground with the
head of the stick close to the helmet with the other hand in position to protect the stick from a check but
also to grab the stick for a shot or a feed—these are decisions that must be made with lightening speed

Offense




Its much harder to stop a shot when the shooter is on the move across the face of the cage. Look at how much net
the shooter sees. Also notice how the shooter’s body is turned. He will get a lot of power from his hips as he
swings them toward the goal while shooting. His elbow is high and aimed at the goal. Perfect form! The goalie,
however, is in perfect position as well and looks ready to pounce. Note as well the attackman behind the net-
ready to back up the shot!!
