# Development Context for Lacrosse Vertical

## Mission: Replicate mpb_e for Lacrosse

**You are being asked to create a complete, production-ready lacrosse vertical application that replicates ALL features, systems, and capabilities of mpb_e, but adapted for lacrosse instead of basketball.**

## Reference Implementation
**Source**: https://github.com/tahjholden/mpb_e  
**Type**: Basketball vertical application (mpb_e = Max Potential Player Development)  
**Architecture**: Full-stack TypeScript/SvelteKit + Supabase + HOS Protocol Stack  
**Production Status**: 22 production systems, 80+ database tables, deployed to Vercel

## What mpb_e Includes (ALL OF THIS MUST BE REPLICATED)

### Core Platform Systems
- **SvelteKit Frontend**: Complete UI with routes for teams, coaches, analytics, sessions, portals
- **Supabase Backend**: Postgres with RLS, real-time, edge functions, auth/RBAC
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for app-wide reactive state
- **UI Component System**: 50+ reusable components with design system
- **Real-time System**: Live updates, notifications, WebSocket integration

### Domain Systems (Basketball â†’ Lacrosse)
- **Session Builder**: Practice timelines CRUD with AI generation
- **Observations & Analytics**: Multi-method capture (voice/text/video), AI tagging, methodology support
- **Development Plan System**: 3-tier structure (Methodology/Coach/Player), AI-enhanced generation
- **Drill System**: Platform drill library, AI selection, constraint-led integration
- **Player Development**: Player profiles, progress tracking, skill assessment
- **Team Management**: Teams, coaches, players, organizations
- **Voice Observation System**: Mobile voice-to-text with domain-optimized processing
- **Methodology Integration**: Traditional, CLA (Constraint-Led Approach), Learning Journey
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: AI-powered developmental reasoning and recommendations

### AI & Intelligence Systems
- **AI Integration**: HOS protocol integration (MCP/RCP/DOS)
- **Intelligence Pipelines**: Transcription, diarization, drill intelligence
- **Smart Surfacing System**: AI-powered content recommendation
- **Coaches Learning Journey**: 5-stage progression system

### User Experience Systems
- **Portal System**: Player and parent portals with development plan visibility
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support with AI translations
- **Communication & Notifications**: Multi-channel delivery with AI-generated content

### Infrastructure Systems
- **Database Security**: Tables with RLS, comprehensive audit logging, RBAC
- **Storage System**: File management with organization-scoped access control
- **Security & Authentication**: Two-tier RLS, comprehensive RBAC, multi-level auth
- **Data Privacy & Security**: COPPA-compliant for minors, parental consent management
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n self-hosted with HRM integration
- **Media Integration**: Multi-platform content processing

## Current State
- Supabase schema `mp_lacrosse` exists with sparse data
- Lacrosse Fundamentals Manual available locally in lacrosse-adapter
- This is an EMPTY repository ready for the full application

## Authentication
- **Superadmin Email**: tahjholden@gmail.com
- Use same login credentials as mpb_e for the superadmin user
- Mock players, coaches, and teams should be created for testing

## Database Schema
- All data lives in `mp_lacrosse` schema (mirror mp_basketball schema structure)
- Use existing sparse data as starting point
- Populate lacrosse skills and drills from fundamentals manual

## Critical Differences: Basketball â†’ Lacrosse

### Domain Concepts
- Basketball becomes Lacrosse
- Basketball skills become Lacrosse skills
- Basketball drills become Lacrosse drills
- Court â†’ Field
- Hoop â†’ Goal
- Basketball positions â†’ Lacrosse positions (Attack, Midfield, Defense, Goalie)

### Schema Changes
- `mp_basketball` schema â†’ `mp_lacrosse` schema
- All basketball-specific concepts â†’ lacrosse equivalents
- Same table structures, different domain content

### Domain-Specific Knowledge
- Parse and import Lacrosse Fundamentals Manual
- Create structured skill and drill database
- Map lacrosse concepts to the development frameworks

## What Codex Must Deliver

**You are building an ENHANCED mpb_e application for lacrosse - not just a copy, but an improvement.**
