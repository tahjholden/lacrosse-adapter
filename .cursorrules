# Lacrosse Vertical Development Rules

## Mission: Complete Replication of mpb_e
You are building the COMPLETE mpb_e application for lacrosse. This is NOT a simple adaptation - it's a full replication of all 22 production systems with enhancements.

## Reference Implementation
- **Primary**: https://github.com/tahjholden/mpb_e
- **Study**: Read mpb_e's PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for complete architecture
- **Replicate**: EVERYTHING from mpb_e

## Critical Instructions

### 1. Complete Application Replication
- Copy ENTIRE mpb_e structure
- All routes, components, services, utilities
- All database tables and migrations
- All AI integrations and HOS protocols
- Complete component library (50+ components)
- All infrastructure features

### 2. Schema Changes ONLY
- `mp_basketball` → `mp_lacrosse` (everywhere)
- Schema: `mp_lacrosse` (mirror mp_basketball structure)
- Basketball → Lacrosse domain translation
- Same table structures, different content

### 3. Lacrosse-Specific Enhancements
- Position-specific training (Goalie, Attack, Midfield, Defense)
- Stick skills fundamentals (cradling, ground balls, shooting)
- Face-off management
- Field zone analytics
- Lacrosse-specific drill library

### 4. Authentication Setup
- Superadmin: tahjholden@gmail.com
- Same login credentials as mpb_e
- Mock players, coaches, and teams

### 5. Knowledge Base Import
- Import Lacrosse Fundamentals Manual
- Create structured skill/drill database
- Map to development frameworks (Traditional, CLA, Learning Journey)

### 6. What NOT to Do
- DON'T create simplified version
- DON'T skip features
- DON'T create "mapping" approach
- DON'T overlook any of the 22 systems
- DON'T skip infrastructure features
- DON'T skip testing

## Code Standards
- Follow mpb_e's code style EXACTLY
- Use same library versions
- Maintain exact file structure
- Keep naming conventions consistent
- Replicate all components and services

## Deliver Complete Production-Ready Application
- All features from mpb_e
- Lacrosse-specific enhancements
- Working authentication
- Mock data for testing
- Complete Supabase integration
- All AI features
- All real-time features
- Complete portal system
- Testing infrastructure
